# LiveCamera 

# WiFi/network setup 

The "network" folder includes the configurations and scripts to set the WiFi working in (AP-STA) dual-mode.  

# Software/system setup  

The "system" folder includes the scripts to manage the software system, e.g. the scripts for systemd service that enabled the camera software automatically launched with the system startup, and the scripts for software update.  


# Camera/video software 

The "camera" folder includes the code and configurations for the camera software, which was designed and implemented as a typical browser/server system. The webserver, websocket server, and video streaming server run on the Raspberry Pi system. The users/administrators connect to the camera system with web browsers, to watch live video or complete administrative operations.
