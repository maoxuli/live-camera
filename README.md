# WiFi/network setup 

The "network" folder includes the configurations and scripts for WiFi setup, which basically set the WiFi working in (AP-STA) dual-mode.  

# Software/system setup  

The "system" folder includes the scripts to manage the software system, e.g. the scripts enable the camera software automatically launched with the system startup, and the scripts update the software remotedly.  

# Camera/video software 

The "camera" folder includes the code and configurations for the camera software, which was designed as a typical browser/server system. The administrative server(s) and video streaming server run on the Raspberry Pi OS. The administrators and common users will connect to the camera system with their web browsers, through the web page(s) they could manage the camera systeam and watch live video.
